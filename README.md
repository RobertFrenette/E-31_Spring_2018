# CSCI E-31:  Introduction to Web Application Development using Node.js (MEAN Stack)

## Harvard Extension School, Spring 2018

### Teaching Assistant: [Rob Frenette](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertmfrenette)

This Repo contains code examples covered in my weekly online Section.

The code for the [Companion App](http://www.mylistsapp.com/) written over the course of the Semester is avaiable in the [E-31_Spring_2018_App Repo](https://github.com/RobertFrenette/E-31_Spring_2018_App).

Note: Although experience with server-side application development is not a prerequisite for this course,
thorough knowledge of client-side web development,
such as basic HTML ([CSCI E-12)](https://www.extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/sections/CSCI/12)
and JavaScript ([CSCI E-3)](https://www.extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/sections/CSCI/3), is recommended.


### MEAN: Mongo / Express / Angular / Node
