# Client Apps
This Repo contains examples of dynamic Client Apps which get data from a JSON file served from a Node HTTP Server.

Although this course focuses on the MEAN Stack (using Angular on the fron-end), I'm providing HTML / PHP / jQuery Mobile front-end examples here which all make an AJAX call to the same Node server for data.  We will cover Angular later in the semester.

Also, the demo_python folder contains an example of calling an external process (Python3 App) to obtain data. This is an "advanced topic" which is not officially part of the course! I'm presenting it as an example for those familair with Python as another way to get data from an external source.
