# Client App
This Repo contains an example of a dynamic client which POSTs/GETs data to/from a JSON file served from a Node HTTP Server.

Although this course focuses on the MEAN Stack (using Angular on the fron-end), I'm providing this front-end example here which makes an AJAX calls to a Node server for data. 

We will cover Angular later in the semester.


## Testing
+ Start Node server
```
$ cd server
$ node server
```

Note: If you fail to start the Node server before launching the Client App, you will get the following error on the Client.

## App Error

### Client
This Client App is built in standard HTML.

+ Simply open ```index.html``` in your browser
+ Load the Add Mountains page to enter Mountains
