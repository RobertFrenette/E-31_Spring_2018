# Angular - Section Demo App
This App builds on the Demo in the [myApp Folder](https://github.com/RobertFrenette/E-31_Spring_2018/tree/master/17_Angular_Section_Demo/myApp), and adds an Observable which connects to a simple Node/Express Server to get Mountain Data.

Please see the corresponding Section recording on the [E-31 Canvas Course Site](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/35096).
